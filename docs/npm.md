Use `npm` modules just like you would use them in any other node app, for example:

```bash
npm install --save jwt
```

And then `package.json` will be updated, and you can use them like anything else:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jwt');
```

During the `zapier build` or `zapier push` step - we'll copy all your code to `/tmp` folder and do a fresh re-install of modules.

> Note: If your package isn't being pushed correctly (IE: you get "Error: Cannot find module 'whatever'" in production), try adding the `--disable-dependency-detection` flag to `zapier push`.

> Note 2: You can also try adding a "includeInBuild" array property (with paths to include, which will be evaluated to RegExp, with a case insensitive flag) to your `.zapierapprc` file, to make it look like:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "key": "App1",
  "includeInBuild": [
    "test.txt",
    "testing.json"
  ]
}

```

> Warning: do not use compiled libraries unless you run your build on the AWS AMI `ami-6869aa05`.
