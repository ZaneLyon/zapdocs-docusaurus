We provide several methods off of the `z` object, which is provided as the first argument to all function calls in your app.

> The `z` object is passed into your functions as the first argument - IE: `perform: (z) => {}`.

### `z.request([url], options)`

`z.request([url], options)` is a promise based HTTP client with some Zapier-specific goodies. See [Making HTTP Requests](#making-http-requests).

### `z.console`

`z.console.log(message)` is a logging console, similar to Node.js `console` but logs remotely, as well as to stdout in tests. See [Log Statements](#console-logging)

### `z.dehydrate(func, inputData)`

`z.dehydrate(func, inputData)` is used to lazily evaluate a function, perfect to avoid API calls during polling or for reuse. See [Dehydration](#dehydration).

### `z.stashFile(bufferStringStream, [knownLength], [filename], [contentType])`

`z.stashFile(bufferStringStream, [knownLength], [filename], [contentType])` is a promise based file stasher that returns a URL file pointer. See [Stashing Files](#stashing-files).

### `z.JSON`

`z.JSON` is similar to the JSON built-in like `z.JSON.parse('...')`, but catches errors and produces nicer tracebacks.

### `z.hash()`

`z.hash()` is a crypto tool for doing things like `z.hash('sha256', 'my password')`

### `z.errors`

`z.errors` is a collection error classes that you can throw in your code, like `throw new z.errors.HaltedError('...')`.

The available errors are:

  * HaltedError - Stops current operation, but will never turn off Zap. Read more on [Halting Execution](#halting-execution)
  * ExpiredAuthError - Turns off Zap and emails user to manually reconnect. Read more on [Stale Authentication Credentials](#stale-authentication-credentials)
  * RefreshAuthError - (OAuth2 or Session Auth) Tells Zapier to refresh credentials and retry operation. Read more on [Stale Authentication Credentials](#stale-authentication-credentials)
