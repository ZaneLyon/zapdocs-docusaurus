Registering your App with Zapier is a necessary first step which only enables basic administrative functions. It should happen before `zapier push` which is to used to actually expose an App Version in the Zapier interface and editor.

```bash
# register your app
zapier register "Zapier Example"

# list your apps
zapier apps
```

> Note: this doesn't put your app in the editor - see the docs on pushing an App Version to do that!

If you'd like to manage your **App**, use these commands:

* `zapier apps` - list the apps in Zapier you can administer
* `zapier register "Name"` - creates a new app in Zapier
* `zapier link` - lists and links a selected app in Zapier to your current folder
* `zapier history` - print the history of your app
* `zapier collaborate [user@example.com]` - add admins to your app who can push
* `zapier invite [user@example.com] [1.0.0]` - add users to try your app version 1.0.0 before promotion
